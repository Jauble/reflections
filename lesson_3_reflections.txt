When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local if I wanted to share my work
or collaborate with others. It's also good to have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you have git automatically pull, you might have changes come in that you're unaware of, which might throw off the code 
you're currently working on.
